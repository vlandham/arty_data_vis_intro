# A Non-Artist's Artistic Introduction to Data Visualization

(notes on the talk)

## WARNING: Fluid and subject to change


## What is Data Visualization? 

* complicated question 
  * many consumers and many producers of visual works

* the role of data visualization is to communicate (data) meaning through stories.

Definition from an old Scott Murray presentation. 

"Stories" is a strange word here - for the non-artist - but let's go with it.

* one story
* 100s of stories


* excluded for now
  * what is data?
  * data is biased. data vis is biased

* data design as a process not a product
  * data visualizations are visual solutions to data driven problems

## What is (a) Data Visualization?

* a visualization is a product of a data design process 
 * can be effective
 * or ineffective


## Tips for Effective Visualizations


## Clarify What And Why

* First step of a process

* Define what you are trying to communicate
 (broad or specific)

* Starts with who you are trying to communicate to
    (your audience)


Start with a  question 
A question your audience wants the answer to
http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/blog/?p=644

Helps to find the story (narrative)

* Audience can be yourself
  * Exploratory vs Explanatory

- respect the data
- respect the audience 


## Rules


- lots of rules to guide you
  -- rules meant to be broken

- Tufte Rules

- Visual Encoding Rules
 

## Know What is Possible

 - everything is a remix

 - find inspiration in other work 
 
## Iterate 

- combine possibilities and best practices together to communicate your what and why

- sketch and hone with these 'success metrics' in mind 


## Context is Key

- context is integration
-- text around to explain
-- make it part of something bigger. 

- context is comparison
- tufte "compared to what"
- hard thing to do


- DONT hide the good stuff
   - especially true in interaction 


## Simplify whenever possible


  - Jonathan Corum example
  - Dashboard example

## A few of my favorite charts

- robust solutions to many problems
 (maybe yours)

-- Bar Charts
  -- its the KING for a reason
  -- good and bad bar charts. 

-- Small multiples
  -- lots if stories - Kepler 
  -- one big story - history of the us

-- Scatter plots
  -- one of the greatest exploratory tools available. 
  -- can also be used to explain
